## Power Consumption of the Raspberry Pi 

### RaspberryPi 3 Benchmark tests show that the faster version 3 consumes more energy
If you don't need the speed-up, which you wouldn't for just *collecting* data with MassMine, one should consider using an older version such as models A+ and Zero. For more see the following link:

### The Glasgow Raspberry Pi Cloud: A Scale Model for Cloud Computing Infrastructures

This paper demonstrates that while the Pi certainly cannot perform the compute power of traditional computer clusters, it can operate at a fraction of the cost and power consumption. For example, a cluster of 56 servers made of traditional x86 computers versus RaspPi is staggering:

|               | Server Cost             | Power Consumption |
|---------------+-------------------------+-------------------|
| x86 Computers | $112,000 (@ $2000 each) | 180 Watts/hour    |
| RaspPi        | $1,960 (@ $35 each)     | 3.5 Watts/hour    |

### Modeling (and minimizing) power consumption on the Raspberry Pi
Paper demonstrating that power consumption can be modeled using software running on the Pi to monitor (and thus minimize, in theory) power consumption. In this case, the paper proposes how the Pi could be used to replace more intensive energy consuming internet gateways in people's homes.

### Energy Efficient Computing: A Comparison of Raspberry PI with Modern Devices
	I want to like this paper. Seems like a great (short) reference demonstrating how the Pi uses significantly less resources for rather standard computing tasks. The source location has me worried enough to not want to cite this unless necessary. That and the authors say that they "prove" something in the abstract. Generally a gigantic red flag... but this could be an ESL issue.
